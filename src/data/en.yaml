# opener

opener: >
  The city spreads out before you. Rushing from point to point, lit by the slow
  strobe of fluorescent buses in dark streets. Stumbling into situations for a
  stranger's signature. Fleeing unknown pursuers, breathing hard, admiring the
  landscape and the multitude of worlds hidden in it. For one night, drop your
  relations, your work and leisure activities, and all your usual motives for
  movement and action, and let yourself be drawn by the attractions of the
  chase and the encounters you find there.

game.heading: The Game
game.abstract: >
  Journey to the End of the Night is a free street game of epic proportion run
  by hard-working volunteers in cities around the world from Budapest to
  Los Angeles.
game.organization: >
  It is a collaborative and voluntary effort by everyone, from the organizers
  to the agents, to you as a player and voice that spreads the word to your
  friends! Let's do this again, Vienna!

# gist/task

task.heading: The Task
task.text: >
  A pursuit across the city in multiple parts: Try to make it through a series
  of checkpoints as quickly and as stealthily as possible, while avoiding being
  caught by chasers. Should you be captured, you become a chaser yourself and
  have to pursue your former friends and allies. No skates, no bikes, no cars —
  just your feet and public transport.

### publicity

publicity.spread.title: Spread the Word!
publicity.spread.text: >
  In order for a great game to happen, we need a lot of people playing! However,
  the Journey is organized without budget for advertising - this means we need
  your help to get the word out. Yes, you - the potential player. Bring your
  friends, your enemies - anyone you know (or don't really know), especially
  those that you think you can outrun.

publicity.how.title: How can I help?
publicity.how.text: >
  Most importantly, talk it up. If you are excited about playing this game,
  inform everyone you come across between now and game time. The bulk of our
  players heard about this game by the genius of advertising that is
  'word-of-mouth.' To make it easier for you to spread the word, we created a
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/526793160853271/">Facebook Event</a>
  which you can share, and to which you can invite your friends. Also
  <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=Join%20me%20for%20a%20free%20street%20game%20of%20epic%20proportion:%20http://www.journeyvienna.at%20%23journeyvienna">tweet about it</a> !

publicity.more.title: Want more?

  If you want to get involved even more, check out the
  <a href="/volunteer/">volunteer page</a> -
  we could still use a few more helping hands!

### volunteer

volunteer.heading: Volunteer information
volunteer.text: >
  We organize great games for everyone - but we always need help
  doing it! The Journey is run by a small crew of enthusiasts, who cannot be
  everywhere at once (as proved at the first run =) ). Please, help us out,
  especially if you've already played the last time!

volunteer.spread.title: Spread the Word
volunteer.spread.text: >
  Most important of all: Help us <a href="/publicity/">spread the word</a>
  about the game!

volunteer.checkpoint.title: Operate a Checkpoint
volunteer.checkpoint.text: >
  If you're artistically inclined or a people person, please consider creating
  and/or staffing a checkpoint! Anything can happen at a checkpoint, as long as
  it draws attention and stands out in the city - be creative!

volunteer.chaser.title: Be a Chaser
volunteer.chaser.text: >
  For each run, we are casting a small crowd of initial chasers - looking for a
  good hunt and some insight in the game's organization? Get in touch!

volunteer.document.title: Document
volunteer.document.text: >
  We love to have good documentation for our journeys - if you're a photo- or
  videographer, contact us and we'll give you the unique opportunity to
  document this amazing game!

### game

game.details.title: Game Details
game.details.text:
  Journey To The End Of The Night is a chase game played across an entire city.
  It is not unlike a foot race mixed with a scavenger hunt and a game of tag.
  The course will be approximately 10km and may take 2 to 4 hours to complete
  (accounting for interference). The finish line will be near a Metro and
  NightLine station.

game.bring.title: What you should bring

    <li>Comfortable shoes</li>
    <li>Water</li>

    <li>Words of encouragement</li>
  </ul>

game.procedure.title: General Procedure
game.procedure.text: >
  Agents will be in disguise at the five checkpoints around the city, waiting
  to sign players’ manifests as they arrive. At the gathering point, a mediator
  will give a verbal description of the Agents at the first checkpoint,
  and so the game begins. Awards, stories and possibly light refreshments
  will be presented at the finish line. The finish line location will be
  in walking distance of at least a Metro station and a few bars.

game.instructions.title: Player Instructions
game.instructions.text: >
  Your goal is to reach the final checkpoint first with a complete manifest and
  without being caught by Chasers. You may walk, run, or use public transport.
  At each checkpoint you must find an Agent to sign your manifest.
  These Agents will instruct you on how to identify the Agent at the next
  checkpoint. If you are caught (tagged), remove your player ribbon and give
  it to the Chaser who got you.  Put on your chaser ribbon. Your goal now is
  to catch other players.
